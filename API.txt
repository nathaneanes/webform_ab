hook_webform_ab_get_webform_types()
	Return a keyed array of webform types. See webform_ab_webform_ab_get_webform_types() for example.

hook_webform_ab_valid_webforms($webform_types)
	Given the webform types being used for a test, return an array of webforms that can be added to the test. Return should be a flat array. Each element should be another array, with nid and title keys. See webform_ab_webform_ab_valid_webforms() for example.

hook_webform_ab_valid_webforms_alter(&$forms, $webform_types)
	Alter hook for the valid webforms list collected by hook_webform_ab_valid_webforms(). This can be used to add or remove webforms that can be included in the test. For example, the funraiser_ab module uses this hook to remove standard webforms from tests that should only include donation forms.

hook_webform_ab_check_win_condition($win_type, $webforms_to_check, $node)
	Check if any of the webforms included in the test $node have won the test. This function should only handle known values of $win_type - that is, winning conditions defined by the module implementing the hook. See webform_ab_webform_ab_check_win_condition() for example.

hook_webform_ab_validate_conversion($webform_types, $test_node, $form_state)
    Check if the form submission should be counted as a conversion. Only run the check if $webform_types is a value supplied by the current module. For regular webforms, this just returns true, since any submission counts as a conversion. Others may check other conditions; for example, fundraiser_ab checks that the payment was successful on a donation form before counting it as a conversion.
